# Library

This project was developed during my time at Digital School. It represents a small desktop application for a library.

To write the program, we used the Eclipse IDE development environment. It was also necessary to install the Java Development Kit on the computers. For graphical user interfaces, JavaFX was employed, requiring the installation of the SceneBuilder graphical environment creation support tool. To store data, we utilized the MySQL database.
