# Library

This project is made during my work at Digital School. 

It represent small desktop application for library. 

To write the program, we used the Eclipse IDE development environment, and it was also necessary to install the Java Development Kit on the computers. For graphical user interfaces, JavaFx was used, requiring the installation of the SceneBuilder graphical environment creation support tool. For storing data we used MySql database and all is hosted localy.
